 <p>
   I have a meme. That one day all memes will be original. The day that all memes are original and made will be the day that humanity will have reached a peak of existence. We would have to make memes on how great humanity is. It would be the reson to live. No more controversial presidents and only presidents chosen on how dank their memes are.
